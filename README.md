AnjinScriptLang
===============
(Yes I know it's not actually a scripting language :D)

Anjin Scripting Language is a C library and IDE. 
It's designed to abstract much of the complexity of developing and deploying in 
C and SDL/openGL. The ultimate goal is that developers will be able to write the 
same code, and then push it to all native platforms and web (planning integration 
with Emscripten once the major functions are in). 

The current state of the code is very fluid and could change at a moments notice!  
This is *not* intended for productio use as I haven't even got the core librarys in yet! D:  

It is currently being developed on a linux machine, with no windows/mac testers so to the people using Win/Mac  
HERE BE DRAGONS! :D
