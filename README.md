AnjinScriptLang
===============
(Yes I know it's not actually a scripting language :D)

Anjin Scripting Language is a C library and IDE. 
It's designed to abstract much of the complexity of developing and deploying in 
C and SDL/openGL. The ultimate goal is that developers will be able to write the 
same code, and then push it to all native platforms and web (planning integration 
with Emscripten once the major functions are in). 

It is not designed to be used for production yet. But it's under intensively active 
development, and the goal is to have the core functions for game development in a usable 
state for the next ludum dare (27 april 2013).
